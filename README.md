# pusher-client

## Description

**pusher-client** is an Emacs library for working with [pusher.com](http://pusher.com)
services. Pusher uses web sockets to send data to clients in realtime.

It's not a particularly useful extension on its own, as there are no interactive
functions, but can be used to build something more interesting.
